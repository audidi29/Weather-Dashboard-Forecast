# Weather-Dashboard-Forecast

This Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for a city and view both current and future weather conditions for that city. It provides a user-friendly interface to quickly access essential weather information. The dashboard also maintains a search history for easy retrieval of weather data for previously searched cities.

## Features
City Search and Weather Display
Users can input a city name in the provided form and search for weather information.
Upon searching for a city, the dashboard displays the current weather conditions along with the future 5-day forecast for that city.
The displayed information includes:
City name
Date
Icon representation of weather conditions
Temperature
Humidity
Wind speed
Search History
The application keeps track of the searched cities and displays them as a search history.
Users can click on a previously searched city in the history to retrieve its current and future weather conditions without re-entering the city name.
